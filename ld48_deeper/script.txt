SKIPWORDS : NEED JUST THIS HERE GOING CANT LIKE SAYS THAT

ARTHUR Oh well, if weâ€™re stuck on this boat at least the bar is well stocked.
ARTHUR Care for a pint? Maybe a glass of wine? Maybe a burger or some fish and chips?
ARTHUR I thought I heard water running in the wine cellar. Do you ever worry about the rain and flooding?
ARTHUR I thought I heard the calling of a seabird, but it was just the generator.
ARTHUR Water flows under everything, here. 

JANET I can't believe he cut off communication! This is practically kidnapping, I don't care what the contract says.
JANET It looks like it might rain soon. Good for the sunflower, the town, and the world, but I need to fix that generator.
JANET Saw a seabird circling. I need to get back inside before the rain. I deserve a sip of wine.
JANET Lightning is dangerous for the tall sunflower, but we need the electricity. Am I right?
JANET A sunflower is not a generator. If you call to a fish it will never answer.

TULIO We outnumber him. It's not a mutiny if he's not actually a captian, just a crazy billionaire.
TULIO I'm just passing through, here. You can keep this little town. Not much going on, it's not even on the map.
TULIO Fish for dinner, everyday. I'd rather eat a sunflower, I'm so tired of this world.
TULIO Janet says violence is not the answer, but sometimes the answer is violence, or maybe wine.
TULIO I'm going to sink this town if I can't get off of here.

ESME Don't be so afraid of the captian. He just needs a few more days to calm down.
ESME Everyone in town is worried about the rain, but I'm like a fish, I love the water.
ESME I bought a sunflower in the shop today to brighten up the glass in my window.
ESME A town is made of people, not buildings or rooms. We're all in this boat together, even the captain.
ESME I'm more afraid of being alone in the world than I am of drowning or violence. There is no answer, we are lost at sea, all of us.

JAMAL What use is a navigator if he won't turn on the engines? 
JAMAL Just ask if you need a map. Oh! I seem to have misplaced it.
JAMAL The captain says one can't be lost if one burns their map.
JAMAL I'm worried that some in the town might resort to violence if we can't talk sense into the captain.
JAMAL A glass of wine made a glyph like a sunflower on my map. Is that the answer?

SANDY There are worse places to be stranded than a fancy yacht surrounded by enchanting gulls.
SANDY (Humming) I called up the captain, said please bring me my wine ...
SANDY So pretty, like fish beneath a glass bottom boat.
SANDY Tulio says he feels trapped here, but where would he go? We are all trapped on this world.
SANDY Sometimes the answer is to enjoy the rain, like a seabird.
