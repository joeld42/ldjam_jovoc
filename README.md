# ldjam_jovoc
My LudumDare jam games (Volume II)

Most of my old LudumDare games can be found at:
https://github.com/joeld42/ld48jovoc

That repo was getting a little big and messy, so I am starting a new one here
for jam games in 2021 and beyond!

Important: If you try to build this, make sure you check it out under a
scratch directory (e.g. scratch/ldjam_jovoc ), as the fips build system creates
a lot of build dirs above it.
